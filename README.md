# Exercises: Functional Programming in Scala

Here is my attempt at the exercises in the book "Functional Programming in Scala".

- Chiusano, P. & Bjarnason, R. (2015). Functional programming in Scala. Manning
  Publications Co. ISBN: 1617290653.

The exercises build on the code in the book, and so, the license is inherited from the
book.
